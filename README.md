# **Hello,** 👋  

### I am [Victor](www.linkedin.com/in/victor-demessance-65a9431b0) 😃  

I am a **French engineer specialized in embedded systems and autonomous technologies**. I just completed a **dual degree in Robotics & Intelligent Autonomous Systems**. 

This page is dedicated to **sharing my passion for computer science**.  
Here, you'll find **projects of various scales**, from experimental prototypes to larger developments designed to deepen my knowledge. 

I have a strong interest in:  
- **Autonomous navigation & robotics** 🚀  
- **Machine learning for robotics application (for example computer vision)** 🤖
- **Embedded software & real-time systems optimization** 🖥️  

As I continue my journey, I hope this repository will reflect the **knowledge I have acquired** in a field where everything is possible and which has become my profession:  
### **Computer Science!** 💻
