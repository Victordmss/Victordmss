# Hello,

### I am [Victor](www.linkedin.com/in/victor-demessance-65a9431b0) :smile:

I'm a future French **engineer** interested in **computer science**, but also in any kind of knowledge.
My favorite pastime is learning and understanding **how things work**. From the smallest insect :beetle: to the largest galaxy  :telescope:, everything can be understood and absorbed.
On this page, I want to share one of my passions, computer science. <br>
Small projects to experiment, or bigger ones to learn. I post everything that I think is interesting to share, both to help and to present my skills.

At the time I write this, I am still a young engineering student with a new look on the world. 
However, I hope that one day this directory will show the knowledge I have acquired in the field where everything is possible and which I want to make my job: 
  - **Computer science** ! :computer:
